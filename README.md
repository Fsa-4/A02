PART 2: Glossary
    **Branch:** A path of progress in development. Branches provide a conceptual framework for the edit/stage/commit process.
    **Clone:** A duplicated version of a repository that lives on your computer rather than on a server or the internet.
    **Commit:** A change made to a file or a set of files. In Git, each save generates a unique code, with saving a file.
    **Fetch:** Retrieving the most recent changes from an online repository without integrating them.
    **GIT:** A decentralized version control system that is open-source.
    **Github:** A platform/service designed for the hosting and collaborative management of Git repositories.
    **Merge:** The act of incorporating changes from one branch into another.
    **Merge Conflict:** Arises when conflicting changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one file is altered while another is deleted.
    **Push:** Transmitting your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
    **Pull:** Refers to  the action of fetching and merging changes. For example, if someone modifies the remote file you are both working on, pulling incorporates those changes into your local copy to ensure it is current.
    **Remote:** The hosted version of a project, typically on a server like GitHub, is connected to local clones for synchronization of changes.
    **Repository:** A storage space or directory where your projects can be stored. It may exist locally on your computer or as a storage space on GitHub or another online hosting service.
